# if.06.22_03_us-currency-checker
## Introduction
You are to write a Java method which provides a matcher for US currency strings. Currencies should be found also if
they are embedded in another string. The currency string itself always starts with a $-sign followed by an optional
blank. After this a number of digits followed by a decimal dot and then again followed by a two more digits occur.

Take care that some of these parts are again optional. Take a careful look into the unit tests of the project to
figure out the detailed requirements of this assignment.
