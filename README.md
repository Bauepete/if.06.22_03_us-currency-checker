# if.06.22_03_us-currency-checker

## Introduction

You are to write a Java method which provides a matcher for US currency strings. Currencies should be found also if they are embedded in another string. The currency string itself always starts with a $-sign followed by an optional blank. After this a number of digits followed by a decimal dot and then again followed by two more digits occur.

Take care that some of these parts are again optional. Take a careful look into the unit tests of the project to figure out the detailed requirements of this assignment.

## Required Tasks

### Setup
- In case of a (home) exercise: Clone the repository
- In case of a quiz or test: Copy the project folder from the test all drive to your desktop

### Work
1. Read and understand the first unit test
1. Do an easy implementation to make the unit test pass
1. In case of a (home) exercise: Commit
1. Read and understand the next unit test
1. Repeat the last three steps until all unit tests are green
   
### Teardown
- In case of a (home) exercise:
  1. Commit regularly (not only with your final solution)
  1. Push your repository
- In case of a quiz or test: copy your project folder to the U-drive (Windows) or to the `/net/<your test name>` directory (Linux) where `<your test name>` has to be replaced by the name of your test account (e.g., `testBB01`).
